# weather.hw

For this homework, i created a weather app that shows the weather and 5 day forecast for the city entered into the search bar. I wasnt able to put the search history into the proper boxes, but the search history saves to local storage and if you click on one of the boxes the weather for that city shows up. I made this using 2 different weather apis.
